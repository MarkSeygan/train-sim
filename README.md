# train-sim
First bigger school project in 1st grade, it's full of flaws. It is something like roller-coaster but written with C#,Windows Forms. Trains can have their schedules set, can control the rail-switches and they all cooperate in traffic to make every train have the shortest trips possible. I keep it to remind me of mistakes in algorithms and implementations I made there.
